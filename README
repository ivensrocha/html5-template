Included:

* LESS (lesscss.org)
* 960 (960.gs)
* jQuery 1.7.1 (jquery.com), using Google API Library (or loading locally if offline)
* Mordernizr 2.5.3

Also the index.html has already a 960 container with header, footer, left and right sidebars and main content (in the middle), which I use it more frequently.

Everything was based using html5boilerplate by Paul Irish!
